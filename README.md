# Human Face Detection  

A machine learning project that detects human faces in images and video streams using **Python, OpenCV, and Deep Learning techniques**. This project highlights the use of computer vision for real-time applications such as security, surveillance, and user authentication.  

---

##  Features  
- Detects human faces in images and real-time video streams.  
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.  
- Lightweight and works on CPU.  
- Easy to extend with deep learning models for higher accuracy.  

---

##  Tech Stack  
- **Python 3.x**  
- **OpenCV**  
- **NumPy**  
- (Optional) **Haar Cascade / DNN / CNN-based models**
